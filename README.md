# Exam project - Banking App

In this app i have developed a banking application with primarily using a Firebase Database to contain all my data. In this app you will be able to create and login to your own account for the bank. When logged in you will be able to see your accounts and the balance on them, furthermore you can create new accounts, pay bills, reset your password and more!

a default account has been created. The login for this is as follows:
Username: 1111111111
Password: qweqwe
